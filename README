websockets
==========

Introduction
------------

Provides a sensible, clean and simple way to write WebSocket-capable servers in
Haskell.

The following program echoes messages back after appending `meow`:

    {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
    import           Control.Monad      (forever)
    import qualified Data.Text          as T
    import qualified Network.WebSockets as WS

    meow :: WS.Connection -> IO ()
    meow conn = forever $ do
        msg <- WS.receiveData conn
        WS.sendTextData conn $ msg `T.append` ", meow"

Installation is provided using cabal:

    cabal install websockets

Authors
-------

An initial WebSockets library was written in 2010 by Siniša Biđin. In 2011, it
was rewritten from scratch, and extended to it's current state by Jasper Van der
Jeugt, who is also the current maintainer.

Development

Pull requests are always welcome!

This library is production-quality. Therefore we have very high standards in
terms of code style, API quality and testing.

We have two kinds of tests: Haskell-based tests (`tests/haskell`), which use the
`test-framework` library. Additionally, there are integration tests available
in `tests/javascript`, which require a browser to run.
