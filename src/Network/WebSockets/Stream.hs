-- | Create a stream from a "receive" and "send" action. The following

--
-- - Regardless of the provided "receive" and "send" functions, reading and
--   writing from the stream will be thread-safe, i.e. this function will create
--   a receive and write lock to be used internally.
--
-- - Reading from or writing or to a closed 'Stream' will always throw an
--   exception, even if the underlying "receive" and "send" functions do not
--   (we do the bookkeeping).
--
-- - Streams should always be closed.
